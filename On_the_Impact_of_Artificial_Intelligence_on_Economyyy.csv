Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) will have a dramatic impact on the global
"economy. This paper provides a systematic review of the economic impact of AI, focusing on"
the promotion of AI on productivity and economic growth; the impact of AI on labor employ-
"ment; and the question of whether AI will increase income inequality. On this basis, a summary"
of how to implement public policies to reduce the potential negative impacts of AI on the em-
"ployment structure and income inequality is provided. Finally, a summary and prospective re-"
search directions are provided.
